# Project Title

The project is for the purpose of just testing my hands and skills on css and HTML. 
it is basically a try to clone the website AMAZON.com.
The website is not a exact copy of the website it is just a clone.




## Appendix

The website uses only the code what i have learnt the meaning and how to use from the most random sources 

To meantion specifically the icons are supplied from the website font awesome and for beginners the basic websites (free)

I would recommend to go unorthodox every time you use them it gives many views and will surely help you
